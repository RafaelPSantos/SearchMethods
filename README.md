# SearchMethods
A game made in python3 along side pygame to demonstrate search methods

Game task list

[x] **n** lines and **n** columns defined by the user, with 2 <= **n** <= 6
[x] User define where and wheter or not will be edges
[x] Horizontal and vertical edges as weight 1, diagonal ones as weight 2^
[x] User define the initial and final vertice

[x] Vertices, edges and their weight will be stored in a 2d array
[x] Apply one search algorithm
[ ] Calculate the Manhattan distance

[ ] Show matrix of adjacent
[ ] Show the fork
[ ] Show the name of each edge in the order thei will be passed by
[ ] Show the traveled distance
[ ] Show the Manhattan distance
[ ] Show the algorithm name
